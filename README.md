## About Me

![Image](Profile.jpg)

My name is Vincent Tu, and I am currently a 3rd year Math-CS student at University of California, San Diego. The reason I have chosen this major is because I personally **love _mathematics_ and also developed an interest in _computer science_**, hence I cam to this college to study the perfect major for me.
